# MoodMagicFinalProject
Mood Magic Therapy is a Google Assistant application which uses Sentiment Tone Analysis to match the user’s mood with the emotions conveyed by musical lyrics. The application acts as a Music Therapy provider, recommending suitable pre-tone-analysed songs to the user based upon their mood. As a multimodal song analyser, the application also provides melodic analysis in addition to lyrics analysis. The objective of the application is to provide a music recommendation system which places lyrics in the forefront on analysis whilst also providing more information and freedom to the user to choose what they would like to listen to whilst speaking to a Google Assistant device such as a mobile phone or a smart speaker. 

# Setup

This section outlines how to access Mood Magic Therapy. Despite the music playing functions requiring the developer’s Spotify account (since Spotify did not allow for the Spotify app to be submitted to their website), the application can still be used via the Google Assistant. The application will let users converse with the system as normal and will recommend music based off the emotions that they are feeling. The application will provide audio analysis since this will be spoken by the Google agent, however, it will not be able to play the recommended song on a new Spotify account. 

To launch the application, simply speak or type ‘Talk to Mood Magic Therapy’ into a Google Assistant device.  Or, to find the application page, users need only search for ‘Mood Magic Therapy’ on the Google Assistant https://assistant.google.com/explore, as shown in Appendix G. Once found (https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/00000096e92c62db), users can click ‘send to device’. The app will launch and the user will be guided through the conversation.
